Project Title: Library Access Tracker

Description:
The Library Access Tracker is a system designed to manage and monitor access to library resources. This project provides a platform where users can check in and check out library materials, and administrators can track these transactions efficiently.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Database: MySQL
- Version Control: Git/GitHub

Features:
1. User Authentication: Secure login and registration for users.
2. Check-In/Check-Out System: Users can check out and return library materials.
3. Transaction Tracking: Admins can view and manage all check-in/check-out transactions.
4. Data Management: Maintain records of all transactions in a MySQL database.

How It Was Made:
1. Setup Repository: Initialized a Git repository and set up the project on GitHub for version control.
2. Database Design: Created a MySQL database to store user and transaction data. Defined tables and relationships to support the check-in/check-out system.
3. Backend Development: Developed the backend logic using Python to handle user authentication, transaction processing, and data management.
4. Frontend Development: Designed and implemented a user interface for interacting with the backend system.
5. Integration: Connected the frontend to the backend, ensuring proper communication between the user interface and the database.
6. Testing: Conducted thorough testing to ensure all features worked as intended and addressed any issues that arose.
7. Deployment: Pushed the final code to GitHub, making it available for deployment.

Challenges & Solutions:
- Challenge: Ensuring data consistency between the frontend and backend.
  Solution: Implemented error handling and validation mechanisms.
- Challenge: Managing user authentication securely.
  Solution: Utilized secure authentication methods and encryption.

Future Improvements:
- Implement additional features such as notifications for overdue items.
- Enhance the user interface for better user experience.
